## *3 Methodology*
### 3.1 General Methodology
How did you proceed to achieve your project goals? 
Describe which steps you have undertaken
Aim: Others should understand your research process

To achieve the project goals, we followed these steps:
1. **Litarature Review:** Understanding existing GAN models and their applications in image detection and generation.
2. **Data Collection & Preparation:** Finding a dataset of apple images for commerical use and preprocessing it for model training.
3. **Model Development:** Building and training the GAN model.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **App Development:** Implementing the model in a Streamlit app for user interaction.
